# Task 3.1
---

sum of all intergers between 5 and 55 sum() add all values within ()

':' includes values from:to

```{r}
x <-sum(5:55); x
```

---
# Task 3.2
---

write function *sumfun* with one input parameter *n* that calculate sum of all integers between 5 and *n*

use function *n* to calculate n= 10, n= 20, n=100

```{r}

sumfun <- function(n){
  n <- sum(5:n)
  return(n)
}

```


write function *sumfun* to parameter *n*
n = the sum of integers from 5 to parameter *n*
return the value of parameter n when sumfun function is used

sumfun returns calculation when give parameter n=

n=10

```{r}
sumfun(10)
```
n= 20
```{r}
sumfun(20)
```
n=100
```{r}
sumfun(100)
```

*Fibonacci sequence*
print first 12 number of Fibonacci sequence
```{r}
fib <- numeric(12)    # creates 12 vectors stored to fib
  fib[1]<-1           #vector 1  is the first number of Fibonacci sequence is 1
  fib[2]<-1           #vector 2 is the second number of Fibonacci sequence is 2  
  for(n in 3:12)      # for each variable n from 3 to 12 
  fib[n] <- fib[n-1]+fib[n-2] #loop (n-1 + n-2), i.e n=3 , vector 3= (3-1 +3-2) 
print(fib)                        # print all the 12 stored vectors

#Task 3.7
---

* use lm to estimate average reaction time of driver to start breaking in seconds
using lm line between dist(ft) and speed^2 (ft/sec)

important info.

* assume reaction time is proportional to time diver applies breaks and 
once breaking commences breaking distance is proportional to square of speed

*1 mile = 5280 ft

*1 hour = 3600 sec

convert speed from mile per hour to sec per ft
view summary and see average of reaction time  at y-intercept of lm line

```{r}
# cars database already loaded

#convert speed (mph) to (sec/ft)= speed (mph) * (5280/3600)
#reaction time is assumed to be equal to breaking distance
# and breaking distance is equal to speed^2
#do calculation and save to new column of cars as speed_new
cars$speed_new <- cars[,1]*(5280/3600)^2

#see if column has been made
head (cars)

# new liner model line, 
line <- lm(formula = dist~speed_new, data = cars)
summary(line)
```
```{r}
#the slope is around 1.8281 as a reaction time in seconds seems acceptable, google searches estimate average breaking times to be around 0.7 ~ 3 secs
#y-intercept is not always a good indicated like in this case it stats going at 0 ft/sec it goes backwards, and can be ignored.
```

```{r}
#plot new scatterplot with new lm line in ft

y <-cars$speed_new
x <-cars$dist
 
ggplot(cars,aes(speed_new,dist)) + geom_point()+ 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm",formula = "y~x")+ labs(title = "Breaking distance against speed (ft/sec)", subtitle = paste("Intercept=",signif(fit$coefficients[[1]],5),             "slope=",signif(line$coefficients[[2]],5)))+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(colour = "blue", size = 16, hjust = 0.5))+
  xlab("speed(ft/sec)") + ylab("distance(ft)")
